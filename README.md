Project Description
Abstract 
In this project, we analyzed the coffee industry in an effort to understand the impact that the deregulation of the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in 1989 had on the production and  prices of coffee. We learned that production was dominated by one major player (Brazil) and that prices and production have risen over the past 20 years with periods of intense volatility. We also learned that the demand curves for the consumption of coffee are relatively inelastic, so - while consumption has increased over the past 20 years - price has not risen as much as production. In future work, we plan to (1) analyze global consumption trends to see how these align with our findings on production and (2) isolate different types of coffee to see how changing consumer preferences have changed production and pricing globally.
